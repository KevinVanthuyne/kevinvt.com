            <p>
              Around 2017 when I was getting into electronics, I thought of this
              project. It was approximately the second project I had on my mind
              when I started the hobby, but I never got around to making it back
              then. <br />
              In December 2019 though, we were going to organise the fifth
              edition of a party in
              <a href="http://tronk.be" class="red-link" target="_blank"
                >Jeugdhuis Tronk</a
              >
              and I wanted to make it special, which was a perfect excuse!
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea was to make eye-catching
              <em>stage lighting effects</em> to hang behind the DJ. I made six
              one-meter tubes containing 60 leds each, a controller that drives
              them all and about 30 built-in animations. The tubes were made
              with WS2813 ledstrips and the controller uses a laptop charger as
              power supply and an <em>Arduino Mega</em> as the brains. The
              controller enclosure and end caps of the tubes were designed in
              <em>Fusion 360</em>. The caps were then 3D printed and the
              enclosure lasercut.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had a lot of setbacks during this project, which caused it to
              take a lot more time than expected. Originally the controller used
              an <em>ESP32</em> with WiFi so the tubes could be wirelessly
              controlled through <em>ArtNet</em> and a <em>VJ software</em>.
              There was also a microphone for a
              <em>sound-controlled mode</em> and instead of a laptop charger I
              utilised a computer power supply. <br />
              Due to frying the ESP, some faulty debugging and a deadline
              closing in, I decided to scale it back to the simpler form it is
              today without ArtNet and sound-controlled mode. The result however
              is still pretty stunning.
