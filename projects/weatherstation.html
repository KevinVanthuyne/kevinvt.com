            <p>
              Before heading out I like to know what the weather will be like
              for the day. If any rain is forecasted I better bring my jacket,
              or if it's going to be very hot I better leave my sweater at home.
              With this weather station I wanted to have all info displayed on a
              screen that's always on.
            </p>
            <p>
              The brains of the station are a <em>Raspberry Pi 3</em>, with a
              temperature sensor connected. Using this sensor and the
              <em>OpenWeatherMaps API</em> the station always knows inside and
              outside temperature, but also forecasts, rainfall, sunset time and
              much more for the rest of the day and even the entire week. The
              information is displayed on 6 <em>8x8 LED matrices</em> that are
              daisy chained together. The station also has a
              <em>light sensor</em> built in to disable the screen when the room
              gets to dark, so the screen doesn't stay on during the night. All
              data is also logged to an <em>SQLite databank</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore the station has an expandable <em>page system</em>.
              This system functions as a menu that can be navigated with the
              rotary encoder ontop of the enclosure. This way an infinite amount
              of pages can be shown, each with different information like the
              min and max temperatures of the day and when they will be reached
              or settings pages to shutdown or reboot the Pi. <br />
              This project could be expanded a lot more, like info about
              rainfall or a page with a clock, but of course I'd have to find
              some more time for this.
            </p>
